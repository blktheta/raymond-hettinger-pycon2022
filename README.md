Notes from Raymond Hettinger's *Pro tips for writing great unit tests* talk presented at PyCon Italia 2022, supplemented by David Andersson's *Writing Great Docstrings* and *Writing Great Test Documentation* articles, with the latter also being a talk presented at PyCon 2023.

The full talk by Raymond Hettinger is availbable at [YouTube][rh_pycon2022_yt], the code examples in the repo are based on the presentation code. While David Andersson's presentation is available at at [PyVideo][da_pycon2023_pv].

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting started
First, [download][py_download_url] and install **Python**. Version `3.10.12` or higher is required.

Secondly, the repo makes use of testing packages such as; **Pytest**, **Coverage**, **Hypothesis** and **Pyflakes**. It is recommended to install the packages in a virtual environment. You can install the packeges seperately by calling:
```bash
pip install packagename
```
Or make use the command below to install the packages according to the configuration file `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## üìñ Project wiki
Explore all feaures of the **Writing Great Unit Test and Documentation** by reading the project [Wiki][repo_wiki_url].

You will find best pracices and practical knowledge from the presentations, as well as code examples to better communicate the testing concepts.

## üîß Usage
Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory. To run the test call:
```bash
pytest test/test_sample_data.py test/test_math_tools.py
```
To measure the code coverage run the command:
```bash
coverage run -m pytest test/test_sample_data.py test/test_math_tools.py
```
And to export the report to html run the command:
```bash
coverage html
```

The code is written with intention to teach about testing concepts and include several `docstrings` explaining the steps taken.
